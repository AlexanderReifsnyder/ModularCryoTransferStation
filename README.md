# Modular Cryo-Transfer Station

Welcome! This project is a collaboration between The Ohio State University and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Full details on the project can be found here.
The goal of this project was to create a cryo-transfer station which could fit a side-entry holder for a Nion STEM. The design is modular and open source, so anyone may use it free of charge. The design is currenty on Version 1. This repository contains two folders for each version. One is pre-exported STLs, ready to print and use immediately. The other contains the SLDPRT source files for anyone who cares to modify the design to suit their specific needs. Each version will also contain a BOM with links to the products used in our prototype.
